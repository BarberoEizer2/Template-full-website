                    <p>The defending world champions will have a shot at defending its title. Despite falling down 2-1 in the series, SK Telecom T1 rebounded to win two games in a row and defeat the ROX Tigers Friday, eliminating their Korean rivals and advancing to the finals. This was the first Worlds series to go a full five games since the Star Horn Royal Club vs. OMG semifinal in 2014.</p>

                    <p>It was a rematch of last year’s Worlds final, which saw SKT become the first team to ever win two Worlds. SKT will have the chance for a third title and the opportunity to become the first team to repeat as world champions when it takes on the winner of Samsung vs. H2K next week at the Staples Center.</p>

                    <p>In a back-and-forth Game 1, SKT never truly gave up control despite ROX Tigers taking three Infernal Dragons and an excellent game from Smeb on Poppy. Peanut finally got to play his Elise, but three failed early ganks put Bengi way ahead as Faker built up a lead in the mid lane.</p>

                    <p>In Game 2, ROX brought out one of the most surprising picks we’ve ever seen on such a big stage — Miss Fortune support. While at first it appeared like a misclick, it actually made some sense — it’s one of the advantages of an evolving one-patch meta. The MF was picked into Zyra, which has been a dominant pick at Worlds, and won the lane hard. MF’s E clears Zyra’s plants, and her ult synergized very well with the rest of ROX’s team comp, and the early pressure negated many of SKT’s strengths.</p>

                    <p>In Game 3, ROX once again locked in the Miss Fortune support, thanks to the perfect storm scenario appearing again: an Ashe AD Carry for ROX and Zyra locked in for SKT. Once again ROX won the bot lane hard in laning phase, effectively chaining ultimates and utilizing ganks from Peanut.</p>

                    <p>In Game 4, SKT banned the Miss Fortune, and ROX responded with an Ashe-Zyra first rotation. ROX also left the Nidalee open, hoping Bengi (who had never played a competitive game with the champion) would pick it. Bengi obliged, and a gank at five minutes earned First Blood for Faker’s Zilean.</p>

                    <p>Game 5 started off with a bang for ROX, as Peanut invaded Bengi (who had jungled both of SKT’s wins) and killed him at four minutes for First Blood. At 41 minutes, SKT marched into ROX’s base, breaking it open and picking up two kills. That allowed the defending champions to close out the comeback, winning 16-7 in 42 minutes.</p>
