                    <p>When winning becomes a routine, routine becomes a Championship. For the second year in a row, Korea's SK Telecom T1 has claimed the Summoner's Cup, defeating Samsung Galaxy in a tense 3-2 series.</p>

                    <p>SKT1's back-to-back Championships are unprecedented. They’ve now won three out of the last four World Championships. At the core of each of those victories lie Faker and Bengi. The two of them are easily the most accomplished duo in League of Legends history. Bang and Wolf also enter an elite pantheon, having now picked up their second World Championship titles on SKT.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 2016 World Championship, SKT has demonstrated their ability to control the pace of the game -- it is a slow, methodical roll that flattens any would-be challengers. But this was their toughest year yet -- both the ROX Tigers, in the Semifinals, and SSG, in the Finals, pushed them to match point. Both series went the distance.</p>

                    <p>Their flashiest plays might be tied to their elusiveness. The 2016 World Championship MVP is, once again, Faker -- he laughed and said the people who picked him for the award must really know League of Legends. He is frequently the target of ganks, but he sidesteps so many abilities with ease. Time and again we’ve watched him dance away from situations that seemed hopeless. It’s as if he’s telling his opponents he doesn’t have time to play their games. This attribute extends to SKT as a whole. They are experts at denying opponents a fight. They’ll kite and kite until the situation is favorable for them. Then they strike.</p>

                    <p>"Our team plays the macro by the books. We play the game properly," says Faker. "To beat us, you need to win mid lane first, then work around that." </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Finals opponent - SSG</h2>

                    <p>Samsung was the final challenger for SKT this year. Game 1 of the Finals of Worlds 2016 saw SKT dominate the pacing of the game for vast swaths until it extended to a 50 minute slugfest. On his signature champion, Viktor, SSG Crown helped his team stall the game.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Crown seemed to be in really good form today," Faker nods. </blockquote>

                    <p>But it wasn't enough. Some late picks allowed Samsung to swing the game into a situation where one bad team fight could have cost SKT the game. But SKT never allowed SSG the opportunity.</p>

                    <p>From there, they constricted the life out of Samsung Galaxy. Their last gasp was silenced. There would be no miraculous comeback -- SKT was mortal only in individual games here or there. But over the course of the series, they were too composed. Faker says he's simply satisfied with ending the year with the highest possible achievement.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">SKT T1,  once again, the worlds champions.</h2>

                    <p>KT stands atop the League of Legends world for the second year in a row -- cool and collected. Dominant. Historic. They are your 2016 World Champions. </p>
